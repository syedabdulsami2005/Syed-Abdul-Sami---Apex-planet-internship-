# Project Methodology

## Phase 1: Planning
- Defined the scope: Local Virtual Network (192.168.1.0/XX).
- Selected targets: Metasploitable 2 as the victim, Kali Linux as the attacker.
- Established rules of engagement: No attacks on external IPs.

## Phase 2: Implementation (Red Team)
1. **Reconnaissance:** Used `ifconfig` and `ping` to map the network.
2. **Scanning:** Deployed `Nmap` to identify open ports. Discovered Port 21 (vsftpd 2.3.4).
3. **Vulnerability Analysis:** Identified CVE-2011-2523 (Backdoor Command Execution).
4. **Exploitation:** Used Metasploit to trigger the backdoor and gain `root` access.

## Phase 3: Incident Response (Blue Team)
1. **Detection:** Monitored `eth0` traffic using Wireshark. Detected SYN scans and unauthorized high-port connections.
2. **Containment:** Applied firewall rules using `iptables` to drop traffic from the attacker's IP.
3. **Eradication:** Verified the connection was severed by attempting to ping the target (resulting in 100% packet loss).

## Phase 4: Reporting
- Documented all findings with screenshot evidence.
- Proposed mitigation strategies (Patching and Firewall Whitelisting).
